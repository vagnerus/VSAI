### Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Why It Matters |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Runtime** | Bun (not Node.js) | ~3x faster startup, native binary bundling, `bun:bundle` feature flags for dead code elimination |
| **UI Framework** | React + Ink | Component-based terminal UI, state management via hooks, reusable across IDE bridges |
| **Search Strategy** | Agentic search (grep/glob) over RAG/vector DB | Better precision, always fresh, no index maintenance, security (no embedding leaks) |
| **Core Loop** | Single-threaded `query()` generator | Simplicity — intelligence lives in the LLM, the scaffold is a dumb loop. AsyncGenerator enables streaming |
| **Multi-Agent** | Coordinator pattern with `AgentTool` + `SendMessageTool` | Fan-out parallel workers for research, serialize for writes. Workers can't see coordinator's conversation |
| **Schema** | Zod v4 | Runtime validation + compile-time type inference in one declaration |
| **Permissions** | Multi-stage pipeline + OS sandbox | Defense in depth: app-level rules → sandbox isolation. Sandbox enables auto-approve for low-risk ops |
| **Feature Gating** | `bun:bundle` compile-time flags | `COORDINATOR_MODE`, `VOICE_MODE`, `PROACTIVE`, `KAIROS` etc. — dead code stripped at build time |

## 🔑 Key Insights Preview

### 1. The Core Loop Is Deliberately "Dumb"

Claude Code's `query()` function is a simple AsyncGenerator loop: send messages → get response → if tool_use, execute tool → push result → repeat. All intelligence lives in the LLM. This is a deliberate architectural choice — a "dumb scaffold, smart model" philosophy.

### 2. Multi-Agent Coordination Is a First-Class Feature

The Coordinator mode transforms Claude Code from a single-agent CLI into an orchestrator that dispatches parallel worker agents. Workers are fully isolated — they can't see the coordinator's conversation history. The coordinator must synthesize worker results and craft self-contained prompts.

### 3. Dead Code Elimination via Feature Flags

`bun:bundle` feature flags are used at build time to completely strip unused code paths. Voice mode, proactive mode, coordinator mode — all are gated behind compile-time flags, producing a smaller binary.

### 4. Permission System Uses Defense-in-Depth

Permissions are checked at multiple levels: app-level config rules → tool-specific permission models → OS-level sandbox (seccomp on Linux, seatbelt on macOS). When sandbox is active, certain operations auto-approve — trading application-layer checks for kernel-level guarantees.
